/**
 A protocol with methods for managing multi-utterance speech recognition requests.

 The methods of this protocol give you fine-grained control over the speech recognition process. Specifically, you use this protocol when you want to know the following:

 - When the first utterances of speech occur in the audio.
 - When the speech recognizer stops accepting audio.
 - When the speech recognition process finishes or is canceled.
 - When the speech recognizer generates a potential transcription.

 Adopt the methods of this protocol in an object and pass that object in to the `delegate` parameter of ``SFSpeechRecognizer/recognitionTask(with:delegate:)`` when starting your speech recognition task.
