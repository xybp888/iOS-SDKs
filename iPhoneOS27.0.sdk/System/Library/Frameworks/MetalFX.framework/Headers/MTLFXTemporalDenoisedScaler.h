/// A denoiser scaler helps reduce noise in an image. You typically use this in situations where your pixels are
/// expensive to produce, such as elaborate ray or path tracing situations, to save processing time by producing a
/// noisy image that this scaler then cleans up before presentation.
///
/// When you configure this descriptor, set the properties that determine the pixel format for each texture to the
/// respective format of the texture you later assign to the scaler. For example, make sure that the format to which
/// you set the ``colorTextureFormat`` property matches the format of the texture you later assign to the scaler's
/// ``MTLFXTemporalDenoisedScalerDescriptor/colorTexture`` property.

/// A common abstraction to all denoiser scalers.
///
/// This protocol defines properties common to all denoiser scalers. You access these properties through
/// any denoiser scaler instance you create by calling construction methods such as
/// ``MTLFXTemporalDenoisedScalerDescriptor/newTemporalDenoisedScalerWithDevice:``.
///
/// ### Conforming to texture usage requirements
///
/// Denoiser scaler instances expose properties, such as ``colorTextureUsage``, that indicate requirements for
/// your textures to be compatible with it. These properties indicate the minimum set of ``MTLTextureUsage`` bits
/// that you are responsible for setting in your texture descriptors for this denoise scaler to use them.
///
/// Your game or app can set extra usage bits on your textures without losing compatibility, as long at its maintains
/// the minimum set the denoiser scaler requests.
///
/// ### Assigning input and output textures
///
/// When you use an instance of a class that conforms to this protocol, you typically set its input and output textures,
/// as well as other properties, and then encode its work to a command buffer.
///
/// MetalFX doesn't track that you assign the same texture instances to each property across different batches of work,
/// the only requirement is that you provide textures that match the pixel formats and dimensions you specify in the
/// ``MTLFXTemporalDenoisedScalerDescriptor`` descriptor instance that creates the scaler instance.
///
/// ### Encoding work
///
/// Once you configure all properties for the current frame of your game or app, you indicate to the scaler instance
/// into which command buffer it encodes its work. You achieve this by calling, for example,
/// ``MTLFXTemporalDenoisedScaler/encodeToCommandBuffer:``.
