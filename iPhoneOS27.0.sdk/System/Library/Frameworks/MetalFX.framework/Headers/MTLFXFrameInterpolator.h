/// ``MTLFXFrameInterpolatorDescriptor/newFrameInterpolatorWithDevice:``.
///
/// ## Conforming to texture usage requirements
/// 
/// Frame interpolator instances expose properties, such as ``colorTextureUsage``, that indicate requirements for
/// your textures to be compatible with it. These properties indicate the minimum set of ``MTLTextureUsage`` bits
/// that you are responsible for setting in your texture descriptors for this frame interpolator to use them.

/// Your game or app can set extra usage bits on your textures without losing compatibility, as long at its maintains
/// the minimum set the interpolator requests.

/// ## Assigning input and output textures
///
/// When you use an instance of a class that conforms to this protocol, you typically set its input and output textures,
/// as well as other properties, and then encode its work to a command buffer.
///
/// MetalFX doesn't track that you assign the same texture instances to each property across different batches of work,
/// the only requirement is that you provide textures that match the pixel formats and dimensions you specify in the
/// ``MTLFXFrameInterpolatorDescriptor`` descriptor instance that creates the scaler instance.
///
/// ## Encoding work
///
/// Once you configure all properties for the current frame of your game or app, you indicate to the scaler instance
/// into which command buffer it encodes its work. You achieve this by calling, for example,
/// ``MTLFXFrameInterpolator/encodeToCommandBuffer:``.
