 The participant that has priority to play audio when it's not possible to play multiple audio sources concurrently.
 
 This participant takes precedence over all other participants to play audio in non-mixable audio routes when concurrent audio playback isn't possible, and only a single participant can play audio. The system unmutes this participant's audio, and mutes the audio of all other participants.

 By default, this value is `nil`. When the current preferred participant finishes, the system sets this value to `nil`. If this value is `nil`, the arbiter doesn't impose any priority on the participants, and the participant that's unmuted is based on the existing selection mechanism.
