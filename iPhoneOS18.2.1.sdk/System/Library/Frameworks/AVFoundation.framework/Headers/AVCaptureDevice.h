 @abstract
    An AVCaptureDevice represents a physical device that provides realtime input media data, such as video and audio.
 
 @discussion
    Each instance of AVCaptureDevice corresponds to a device, such as a camera or microphone. Instances of AVCaptureDevice cannot be created directly. An array of all currently available devices can also be obtained using the AVCaptureDeviceDiscoverySession. Devices can provide one or more streams of a given media type. Applications can search for devices matching desired criteria by using AVCaptureDeviceDiscoverySession, or may obtain a reference to the default device matching desired criteria by using +[AVCaptureDevice defaultDeviceWithDeviceType:mediaType:position:].
 
    Instances of AVCaptureDevice can be used to provide media data to an AVCaptureSession by creating an AVCaptureDeviceInput with the device and adding that to the capture session.

    On iOS, use of AVCaptureDevice's setActiveFormat: and AVCaptureSession's setSessionPreset: are mutually exclusive. If you set a capture device's active format, the session to which it is attached changes its preset to AVCaptureSessionPresetInputPriority. Likewise if you set the AVCaptureSession's sessionPreset property, the session assumes control of its input devices, and configures their activeFormat appropriately. Note that audio devices do not expose any user-configurable formats on iOS. To configure audio input on iOS, you should use the AVAudioSession APIs instead (see AVAudioSession.h).
 
    The activeFormat, activeVideoMinFrameDuration, and activeVideoMaxFrameDuration properties may be set simultaneously by using AVCaptureSession's begin/commitConfiguration methods:
 
    [session beginConfiguration]; // the session to which the receiver's AVCaptureDeviceInput is added.

    When exposureMode is AVCaptureExposureModeCustom, setting the activeVideoMinFrameDuration affects max frame rate, but not exposureDuration. You may use setExposureModeCustomWithDuration:ISO:completionHandler: to set a shorter exposureDuration than your activeVideoMinFrameDuration, if desired.

 @discussion
    An AVCaptureDevice's activeVideoMaxFrameDuration property is the reciprocal of its active minimum frame rate. To limit the min frame rate of the capture device, clients may set this property to a value supported by the receiver's activeFormat (see AVCaptureDeviceFormat's videoSupportedFrameRateRanges property).

    When exposureMode is AVCaptureExposureModeCustom, frame rate and exposure duration are interrelated. If you call setExposureModeCustomWithDuration:ISO:completionHandler: with an exposureDuration longer than the current activeVideoMaxFrameDuration, the activeVideoMaxFrameDuration will be lengthened to accommodate the longer exposure time. Setting a shorter exposure duration does not automatically change the activeVideoMinFrameDuration or activeVideoMaxFrameDuration. To explicitly increase the frame rate in custom exposure mode, you must set the activeVideoMaxFrameDuration to a shorter value. If your new max frame duration is shorter than the current exposureDuration, the exposureDuration will shorten as well to accommodate the new frame rate.

    - Delivery of photos from constituent devices (ultra wide, wide and telephoto cameras) via a single photo capture request.

    A device of this device type does not support the following features:
    - AVCaptureExposureModeCustom and manual exposure bracketing.
    - Locking focus with a lens position other than AVCaptureLensPositionCurrent.
    - Locking auto white balance with device white balance gains other than AVCaptureWhiteBalanceGainsCurrent.

    Even when locked, exposure duration, ISO, aperture, white balance gains, or lens position may change when the device switches from one camera to the other. The overall exposure, white balance, and focus position however should be consistent.

 @enum AVCapturePrimaryConstituentDeviceSwitchingBehavior
 @abstract
    These constants can be used to control when the virtual device is allowed to switch the active primary constituent device.
 
 @constant AVCapturePrimaryConstituentDeviceSwitchingBehaviorUnsupported
    Indicates that the device does not support constituent device switching. This is reported for cameras that do not have more than one constituent device.
 @constant AVCapturePrimaryConstituentDeviceSwitchingBehaviorAuto
    Automatically select the best camera for the current scene. In this mode there are no restrictions on when a camera switch can occur.
 @constant AVCapturePrimaryConstituentDeviceSwitchingBehaviorRestricted
    Restrict fallback camera selection to certain conditions (see AVCapturePrimaryConstituentDeviceRestrictedSwitchingBehaviorConditions). Camera switches necessary to satisfy the requested video zoom factor are still allowed without restriction.
 @constant AVCapturePrimaryConstituentDeviceSwitchingBehaviorLocked
    Lock camera switching to the active primary constituent device. Note that this restricts the minAvailableVideoZoomFactor to the switch-over zoom factor of the activePrimaryConstituentDevice (as reported in AVCaptureDevice.virtualDeviceSwitchOverVideoZoomFactors).
 
 @discussion
    Virtual devices with multiple constituent video devices (such as the Dual Camera, Dual Wide Camera, or Triple Camera), consist of cameras that each have different properties such as focal length, maximum light sensitivity, and minimum focus distance. One of the constituent video devices is selected as the primary constituent device. For an AVCaptureSession, the primary constituent device produces for all outputs. For an AVCaptureMultiCamSession, the primary constituent device produces for all outputs connected to the virtual device's native AVCaptureDeviceInputPort (where its sourceDeviceType is equal to the virtual device's deviceType).

    When the requested zoom factor can be achieved by multiple constituent cameras (see -virtualDeviceSwitchOverVideoZoomFactors), the virtual device chooses the best camera for the scene. The primary condition for this is the focal length; the camera with the longest focal length requires the least amount of digital upscaling and therefore normally provides the highest image quality. Secondary conditions are focus and exposure; when the scene requires focus or exposure to go beyond the limits of the active primary constituent device, a camera with a shorter focal length may be able to deliver a better quality image. Such a device is called a fallback primary constituent device. For example, a telephoto camera with a minimum focus distance of 40cm is not able to deliver a sharp image when the subject in the scene is closer than 40cm. For such a scene, the virtual device will switch to the wide-angle camera which typically has a smaller minimum focus distance and is able to achieve accurate focus on the subject. In this case the wide-angle camera is the fallback primary constitute device.

 @abstract
    These constants can be used and combined to control the conditions that allow fallback camera selection when the primaryConstituentDeviceSelectionBehavior is set to AVCapturePrimaryConstituentDeviceSwitchingBehaviorRestricted. Note that camera switching necessary to satisfy the requested zoom factor is still allowed.
 
 @constant AVCapturePrimaryConstituentDeviceRestrictedSwitchingBehaviorConditionNone
    Disallow fallback switching.
 @constant AVCapturePrimaryConstituentDeviceRestrictedSwitchingBehaviorConditionVideoZoomChanged
    Restrict fallback camera switching to when the video zoom factor changes, either through AVCaptureDevice.videoZoomFactor or -[AVCaptureDevice rampToVideoZoomFactor:withRate:]. Note that any change in video zoom factor will allow a switch to a fallback camera, not just changes across switch-over zoom factors.
 @constant AVCapturePrimaryConstituentDeviceRestrictedSwitchingBehaviorConditionFocusModeChanged
    Restrict fallback camera switches to when AVCaptureDevice.focusMode is set.
 @constant AVCapturePrimaryConstituentDeviceRestrictedSwitchingBehaviorConditionExposureModeChanged
    Restrict fallback camera switches to when AVCaptureDevice.exposureMode is set.
 
 @discussion
    Whenever triggered by one or more of the enabled conditions, the fallback camera switching waits for exposure and focus to stabilize before deciding which camera to use as the primary constituent device.
 
    Whenever AVCapturePrimaryConstituentDeviceRestrictedSwitchingBehaviorConditionVideoZoomChanged is not included in the restricted switching behavior conditions, AVCapturePrimaryConstituentDeviceSwitchingBehaviorRestricted still allows camera selection when a change in video zoom factor makes a camera eligible or ineligible to be selected as the activePrimaryConstituentDevice. When the video zoom factor decreases to below the switch-over zoom factor of the activePrimaryConstituentDevice, a different camera will be selected to satisfy the requested zoom factor. When the video zoom factor increases and crosses a camera's switch-over zoom factor, this camera becomes eligible to be selected as the activePrimaryConstituentDevice. If exposure and focus allow, this camera then becomes the new activePrimaryConstituentDevice. Similar to the AVCapturePrimaryConstituentDeviceRestrictedSwitchingBehaviorConditionVideoZoomChanged this also waits for exposure and focus to stabilize. Otherwise the activePrimaryConstituentDevice remains unchanged.

    The maximum exposure (integration) time that may be used by the auto exposure algorithm.
 
 @discussion
    When an AVCaptureDevice's exposureMode is set to AVCaptureExposureModeAutoExpose or AVCaptureExposureModeContinuousAutoExposure, the auto exposure algorithm picks a default max exposure duration that is tuned for the current configuration, balancing low light image quality with motion preservation. By querying or key-value observing this property, you may find out the current max exposure duration in use.

An NSRangeException is thrown if you pass an out-of-bounds exposure duration. Setting the property to the special value of kCMTimeInvalid resets the auto exposure max duration to the device's default for your current configuration. When the device's activeFormat or the AVCaptureSession's sessionPreset changes, this property resets to the default max exposure duration for the new format or session preset.
 
    On some devices, the auto exposure algorithm picks a different max exposure duration for a given format depending whether you used the -[AVCaptureSession setSessionPreset:] API or the -[AVCaptureDevice setActiveFormat:] API to set the format. To ensure uniform default handling of max exposure duration, you can set your AVCaptureDeviceInput's unifiedAutoExposureDefaultsEnabled property to YES.

    The exposure duration, as described in the documentation for the exposureDuration property. A value of AVCaptureExposureDurationCurrent can be used to indicate that the caller does not wish to specify a value for exposureDuration. Note that changes to this property may result in changes to activeVideoMinFrameDuration and/or activeVideoMaxFrameDuration.

    The exposure ISO value, as described in the documentation for the ISO property. A value of AVCaptureISOCurrent can be used to indicate that the caller does not wish to specify a value for ISO.
 @param handler
    A block to be called when both exposureDuration and ISO have been set to the values specified and exposureMode is set to AVCaptureExposureModeCustom. If setExposureModeCustomWithDuration:ISO:completionHandler: is called multiple times, the completion handlers will be called in FIFO order.

This method throws an NSGenericException if called without first obtaining exclusive access to the receiver using lockForConfiguration:. When using AVCapturePhotoOutput to capture photos, note that the photoQualityPrioritization property of AVCapturePhotoSettings defaults to AVCapturePhotoQualityPrioritizationBalanced, which allows photo capture to temporarily override the capture device's ISO and exposureDuration values if the scene is dark enough to warrant some form of multi-image fusion to improve quality. To ensure that the receiver's ISO and exposureDuration values are honored while in AVCaptureExposureModeCustom or AVCaptureExposureModeLocked, you must set your AVCapturePhotoSettings.photoQualityPrioritization property to AVCapturePhotoQualityPrioritizationSpeed. The same rule applies if you use the deprecated AVCapturePhotoSettings.autoStillImageStabilizationEnabled property or AVCaptureStillImageOutput.automaticallyEnablesStillImageStabilizationWhenAvailable property. You must set them to NO to preserve your custom or locked exposure settings.

 @discussion
    Tone mapping is a technique used by the device to map the pixel levels in high dynamic range images to a more limited dynamic range (such as 16 bit to 8 bit), while still retaining as close an appearance as possible. Normally the device employs adaptive, local tone curves to preserve highest image quality and adapt quickly to changing lighting conditions.
 
    This property indicates to the receiver to use a global tone map. If set to YES, the tone map is adjusted dynamically depending on the current scene and the same tone map is applied to all pixels in an image. If set to its default value of NO, different tone maps may be applied to different pixels in an image.
 
    globalToneMappingEnabled may only be set to YES if the receiver's activeFormat.isGlobalToneMappingSupported property returns YES, otherwise an NSGenericException is thrown. Setting globalToneMappingEnabled throws an NSGenericException if called without first obtaining exclusive access to the receiver using lockForConfiguration:.
 
    When global tone mapping is enabled, an AVCapturePhotoOutput connected to the AVCaptureDeviceInput’s session disables all forms of still image fusion, resulting in still images with no automatic stabilization applied.
 
    The receiver’s globalToneMappingEnabled resets to its default value of NO under the following conditions:
     - The receiver’s activeFormat changes
     - The receiver’s AVCaptureDeviceInput’s session’s sessionPreset changes
     - The receiver’s AVCaptureDeviceInput is added to a session

    Some AVCaptureDevices benefit from geometric distortion correction (GDC), such as devices with a very wide field of view. GDC lessens the fisheye effect at the outer edge of the frame at the cost of losing a small amount of vertical and horizontal field of view. When GDC is enabled on the AVCaptureDevice (see geometricDistortionEnabled), the corrected image is upscaled to the original image size when needed.  With respect to the AVCaptureDevice.videoZoomFactor API, the full viewable field of view is always represented with a videoZoomFactor of 1.0. Thus, when GDC is enabled, the AVCaptureDevice.activeFormat's field of view at videoZoomFactor = 1.0 will be different than when GDC is disabled. The smaller field of view is reported through the activeFormat's geometricDistortionCorrectedVideoFieldOfView property. Beware though that RAW photo captures never have GDC applied, regardless of the value of AVCaptureDevice.geometricDistortionCorrectionEnabled.

 @enum AVCaptureVideoStabilizationMode
 @abstract
    Constants indicating the modes of video stabilization supported by the device's format.
 
 @constant AVCaptureVideoStabilizationModeOff
    Indicates that video should not be stabilized.
 @constant AVCaptureVideoStabilizationModeStandard
    Indicates that video should be stabilized using the standard video stabilization algorithm introduced with iOS 5.0. Standard video stabilization has a reduced field of view. Enabling video stabilization may introduce additional latency into the video capture pipeline.
 @constant AVCaptureVideoStabilizationModeCinematic
    Indicates that video should be stabilized using the cinematic stabilization algorithm for more dramatic results. Cinematic video stabilization has a reduced field of view compared to standard video stabilization. Enabling cinematic video stabilization introduces much more latency into the video capture pipeline than standard video stabilization and consumes significantly more system memory. Use narrow or identical min and max frame durations in conjunction with this mode.
 @constant AVCaptureVideoStabilizationModeCinematicExtended
    Indicates that the video should be stabilized using the extended cinematic stabilization algorithm. Enabling extended cinematic stabilization introduces longer latency into the video capture pipeline compared to the AVCaptureVideoStabilizationModeCinematic and consumes more memory, but yields improved stability. It is recommended to use identical or similar min and max frame durations in conjunction with this mode.
 @constant AVCaptureVideoStabilizationModePreviewOptimized
    Indicates that video should be stabilized using the preview optimized stabilization algorithm. Preview stabilization is a low latency and low power algorithm which is supported only on connections which either have an associated preview layer or have a preview-sized VideoDataOutput.
 @constant AVCaptureVideoStabilizationModeCinematicExtendedEnhanced
    Indicates that the video should be stabilized using the enhanced extended cinematic stabilization algorithm. Enhanced extended cinematic has a reduced field of view compared to extended cinematic, without any noticeable increase in latency, and it yields improved stability. It is recommended to use identical or similar min and max frame durations in conjunction with this mode.
 @constant AVCaptureVideoStabilizationModeAuto
    Indicates that the most appropriate video stabilization mode for the device and format should be chosen.

When enabled, the device streams at twice the published frame rate, capturing an under-exposed frame and correctly exposed frame for each frame time at the published rate. Portions of the under-exposed frame are combined with the correctly exposed frame to recover detail in darker areas of the scene. EDR is a separate and distinct feature from 10-bit HDR video (first seen in 2020 iPhones). 10-bit formats with HLG BT2020 color space have greater dynamic range by virtue of their expanded bit depth and HLG transfer function, and when captured in movies, contain Dolby Vision metadata. They are, in effect, "always on" HDR. And thus the videoHDRSupported property is always NO for 10-bit formats only supporting HLG BT2020 colorspace, since HDR cannot be enabled or disabled. To enable videoHDR (EDR), set the AVCaptureDevice.videoHDREnabled property.

    By default, AVCapturePhotoOutput and AVCaptureStillImageOutput emit images with the same dimensions as their source AVCaptureDevice's activeFormat.formatDescription property. Some device formats support high resolution photo output. That is, they can stream video to an AVCaptureVideoDataOutput or AVCaptureMovieFileOutput at one resolution while outputting photos to AVCapturePhotoOutput at a higher resolution. You may query this property to discover a video format's supported high resolution still image dimensions.

    AVCaptureDeviceFormats of type AVMediaTypeDepthData may also support the delivery of a higher resolution depth data map to an AVCapturePhotoOutput. Chief differences are:
       - Depth data accompanying still images is not supported by AVCaptureStillImageOutput. You must use AVCapturePhotoOutput.
       - By opting in for depth data ( -[AVCapturePhotoSettings setDepthDataDeliveryEnabled:YES] ), you implicitly opt in for high resolution depth data if it's available.

    If an AVCaptureDeviceFormat's highPhotoQualitySupported property is YES, the format produces higher image quality when selecting .balanced or .quality AVCapturePhotoQualityPrioritization compared to .speed. Such formats adhere to the following rules:
        - Photo requests with a prioritization of .speed produce the fastest image result (suitable for burst captures).
        - Photo requests with a prioritization of .balanced produce higher image quality without dropping frames if a video recording is underway.
        - Photo requests with a prioritization of .quality produce high image quality and may cause frame drops if a video recording is underway. For maximum backward compatibility, photo requests on high photo quality formats set to .quality only cause video frame drops if your app is linked on or after iOS 15.
    Formats that don't support high photo quality produce the same image quality whether you select .speed, .balanced, or .quality. Note that high photo quality is only attainable when using the AVCapturePhotoOutput with these supported formats.

    This property returns the zoom ranges within which depth data can be delivered.

@discussion
    Virtual devices support limited zoom ranges when delivering depth data to any output. If this device format has no -supportedDepthDataFormats, this property returns an empty array.
    The presence of one or more ranges where the min and max zoom factors are not equal means that "continuous zoom" with depth is supported.
    For example:
    a) ranges: @[ [2..2], [4..4] ]
        only zoom factors 2 and 4 are allowed to be set when depthDataDelivery is enabled. Any other zoom factor results in an exception.
    b) ranges: @[ [2..5] ]
        depthDataDelivery is supported with zoom factors [2..5]. Zoom factors outside of this range may be set, but will result in loss of depthDataDeliery. Whenever zoom is set back to a value within the range of [2..5], depthDataDelivery will resume.
 
    When depth data delivery is enabled, the effective videoZoomFactorUpscaleThreshold will be 1.0, meaning that all zoom factors that are not native zoom factors (see AVCaptureDevice.virtualDeviceSwitchOverVideoZoomFactors and AVCaptureDevice.secondaryNativeResolutionZoomFactors) result in digital upscaling.
