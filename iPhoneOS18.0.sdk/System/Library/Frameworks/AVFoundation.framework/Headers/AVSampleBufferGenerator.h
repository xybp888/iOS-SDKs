 @enum AVSampleBufferRequestMode
 @abstract

 @constant	AVSampleBufferRequestModeImmediate
	Sample data for requests with AVSampleBufferRequestModeImmediate will be loaded as soon as possible. The current time represented by AVSampleBufferGenerator's timebase has no influence on these requests.
 @constant	AVSampleBufferRequestModeScheduled
	AVSampleBufferRequestModeScheduled indicates that a request is needed by the time AVSampleBufferGenerator's timebase reaches the CMSampleBuffer's presentationTime or, if specificed, AVSampleBufferRequest's overrideTime. The AVSampleBufferGenerator will attempt to deliver sample data with sufficient leeway for downstream processing. It will also attempt to hold off on loading data until the CMSampleBuffer is needed. If AVSampleBufferGenerator's timebase has a rate of zero, this mode behaves like AVSampleBufferRequestModeImmediate.
 @constant	AVSampleBufferRequestModeOpportunistic
 	The AVSampleBufferGenerator will attempt to read data for opportunistic requests as soon as possible. However, in situations with multiple competing requests, the AVSampleBufferGenerator may defer an opportunistic request in favor of another immediate request or a scheduled requests with a presentation time close to the timebase time. Because a request with AVSampleBufferRequestModeOpportunistic may be postponed indefinitely, this mode should not be used for time-sensitive processing.
